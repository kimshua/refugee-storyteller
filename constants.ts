Leaving wasn't a choice; it was a necessity born of hunger and a yearning for something I couldn't name yet. The darkness of the North was absolute, a void I was stepping out of, hoping the light on the other side wouldn't blind me.",

To reach South Korea, I had to travel thousands of miles through Southeast Asia. Thailand was the gateway. The moment I saw the South Korean flag at the embassy, my knees gave out.",

We speak of survival; they speak of careers. My biggest challenge isn't the prejudice, though it exists. It's the loneliness of being among people who look like you but have lived in a different universe."

        title: 'Bread and Cloth',
        content: "A street in Afghanistan is not only a street.\n\nIt is heat trapped under cloth. It is the rasp of fabric against skin when a woman steps outside. It is the small pause before moving forward, because leaving the house is no longer simple. Women and girls cannot work. They cannot go to school. Outside requires a covering that turns breathing into a task.\n\nSomewhere, a mother sits low to the ground with a child pressed against her. A cart rattles past with small goods, the kind you sell when selling is not a dream but a last door still open. People count bread the way others count time. One meal. Sometimes less. Sometimes nothing but dry crumbs that do not soften.\n\nThe family in South Korea hears this reality from afar, but it is not far. It arrives through messages, through calls, through the knowledge that the economy has collapsed so completely that survival becomes a daily negotiation.\n\nThis is not a story about weakness.\n\nIt is a story about what people do when choice disappears.",

        title: 'The Thin Line of Money',
        content: "In Afghanistan, some families stay alive because money arrives from another country.\n\nNot much. Just enough to hold the day together.\n\nA transfer lands, and someone buys bread. A phone charge. A small thing that keeps a household from tipping into the street. When it does not come, the options shrink until there is only waiting, and then asking, and then sitting for hours in a market where people move past without meeting your eyes.\n\nIt is not laziness. It is the moment when work is forbidden, when jobs are gone, when the safety net has holes wide enough for a whole family to fall through.\n\nIn South Korea, the husband works and sends what he can. The act itself is quiet. No celebration. Just a decision repeated again and again. A responsibility that stretches across borders.\n\nThe wife watches him leave, and she knows the line is thin. She knows it can break on a week when work disappears here too.\n\nIn the file, there is an image of a mother beside a girl. A sign. A posture that looks like the end of the road.\n\nThe story does not need the word tragedy.\n\nThe picture already has weight.",

        content: "Their family is five.\n\nIn South Korea, only the husband works.\n\nHis schedule is not stable. Two days of work, then two days without. The pattern makes ordinary things feel uncertain. Grocery bags become calculations. Bills become questions. The week becomes something you brace for.\n\nHe sends living expenses to family members in Afghanistan while trying to hold this household together. It means his work in South Korea never belongs only to South Korea. It travels.\n\nThe wife wants to work too. Even part time. Not for pride. For relief. For the feeling that she is not watching her family slide through her fingers because childcare costs more than they can bear.\n\nBut she cannot work because the children need her.\n\nThe apartment holds the small sounds of that reality. A television playing for too long. A phone screen lighting up again. A child pacing, then stopping, then pacing again.\n\nSome Afghan families in Korea are stable, the file says. Businesses. Homes. Grown children. Help around the house. Their situation is different.\n\nThey are asking to be seen in the specific shape of their need.\n\nNot as a category.\n\nAs a family.",

The door opens, closes. The child remains in the quiet that follows. She grows restless. She grows lonely. Sometimes she cries.\n\n“I want to go to school,” she says.\n\nThe words are small, but they fill the room.\n\nThe son, Usman, goes to school, then comes straight home. After class, he spends most of the day with the TV or a phone. Not because this is what the family wants for him, but because there is nowhere else to put the hours. No after school care. No lessons. No space that belongs to him the way other children seem to belong to their afternoons.\n\nHe speaks the sentence that returns again and again.\n\n“My friends go to taekwondo or piano after school. Why can’t I?”\n\nThe mother hears it and feels pain rise before she can stop it.\n\nShe wants to answer with something that fixes it.\n\nBut the only honest answer is cost.\n\nShe does not want her children to learn the word cost too early.",

She remembers the years when depression took her down and medication carried her through. She is better now, she says, but there are still moments when her heart feels sore and trapped.\n\nIn a foreign country, there are no nearby relatives. No one to sit with and speak freely. No place to spill a thought for five minutes and feel lighter.\n\nStill, she endures each day with gratitude.\n\nShe places her hope in God.\n\nAt the end of the file, the family makes a careful request. Afghan families in Korea are not all the same. Some are stable. Some have resources. Helping everyone at once takes time and preparation.\n\nSo they ask, first, to introduce their family.\n\nNot because they are more important.\n\nBecause their childcare and education situation is urgent.\n\nNo daycare for the youngest. No after school programs or private lessons for the children. A life shaped by what is missing.\n\nIf support could come, let it come in practical forms.\n\nChildcare.\n\nAfter school care.\n\nA chance for their children to breathe after school the way other children do.",
